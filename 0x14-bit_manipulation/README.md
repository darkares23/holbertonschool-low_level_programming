*How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators*

*0-binary_to_uint.c: function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.*
*1-print_binary.c: function that prints the binary representation of a number.*
*2-get_bit.c: function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.*
*3-set_bit.c: function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.*
*4-clear_bit.c: function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index*
*5-flip_bits.c: function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.*
